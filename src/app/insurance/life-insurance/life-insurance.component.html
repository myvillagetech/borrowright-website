            <div>
                <p>A life insurance is a formidable financial cushion necessary for all. While it offers security to a
                    family with a single breadwinner, it also helps individuals secure their life, especially post
                    retirement. This is because a life insurance can be claimed by the insured even after it reaches
                    maturity. It, therefore, promises a financially secured future, irrespective of anyone’s marital
                    status, job or business stability.</p>

                <h2><span>What is Life Insurance?</span></h2>
                <p><span>Life Insurance is an assurance of financial cover to a beneficiary upon the death of the
                        insurance holder or after a maturity period. This arrangement is entered through a legally
                        binding contract between an insurance policy seller or provider and an insurance policyholder.
                        The recipient appoints a beneficiary who will receive an insured financial aid after the death
                        of the insurance holder. The insured amount is compiled over time by the policyholder through
                        recurring monthly premium payments.</span></p>

                <h2><span>Types of Life Insurance</span></h2>
                <p><span>Even though life insurance, in general, is a straightforward financial investment with assured
                        returns over maturity or after the death of the insured, there are various kinds of life
                        insurances offered to the residents of India. These variations have their own targeted customers
                        who may benefit from them uniquely. One has to carefully consider these types before choosing a
                        plan that best suits them.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span>Here are the types of life insurances offered in India.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Term Life Insurance</span></h3>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>Term life insurance is a fairly basic and common insurance plan where customers have the
                        freedom to choose a term for their insurance, such as 10 years, 20 years, etc. This kind has a
                        relatively cheaper premium due to its nature being a pure life cover. There are usually not any
                        returns under normal conditions or expiration of the term period. The benefits are only provided
                        in case of death or illness. The financial benefit is provided to the beneficiary of the
                        insurance holder after his/her death during the term.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Whole Life Insurance</span></h3>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>A whole life insurance policy offers a financial cover for the entire lifetime of the
                        policyholder. It is only after the demise of the policyholder that the beneficiary receives the
                        premium amount. There are several benefits available with whole life insurance, such as
                        collateral benefits for availing loans, dividend paybacks at regular intervals, etc.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Endowment Plan</span></h3>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>A two-way beneficial life insurance plan is just as much an insurance policy as it is an
                        investment with returns. The endowment plan life insurance policyholder will have the benefit of
                        receiving the full amount upon the expiration date of the policy along with the profits or bonus
                        relative to the number of years the insured survived. Many see this as an investment opportunity
                        that also provides a life cover.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Money-Back Policy</span></h3>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>With a money-back life insurance policy, customers are eligible to receive a sum of money at
                        regular intervals along with the full payment at the expiration of the term or after the death
                        of the insurance holder. Being an extremely rewarding policy, Money-Back Life Insurance Policy
                        is one of the most expensive policies to purchase. It is worth considering given its returns are
                        assured in the form of survival benefits, death benefits and term-expiration benefits.</span>
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)</span></h3>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>A hybrid of life insurance and investing, Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) is a unique and
                        popular life insurance plan to look out for. The special features of ULIP include allocation of
                        funds towards the policyholders' life insurance and rest invested in the various Investment
                        instruments such as mutual funds, equities, etc. There are benefits of ULIP for a policyholder
                        in terms of cash-flow allocation in relation to market behavior. The percentage of funds
                        allocated for investments is generally handled by an expert fund manager.</span></p>

                <h2><span>How Much Life Insurance to Buy?</span></h2>
                <p><span>One may not think about it every day every now and then, but death is very well an aspect of
                        life that is inevitable. Indeed there are many families that are dependent on a sole breadwinner
                        for the family. In situations like these, it is highly advisable to consider a financial cushion
                        for the dependents in times of crisis. Life insurance is capable of providing families with
                        support for debt payback, managing day-to-day expenses, funding funerals,
                        etc.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span>But the real question is “How much life insurance to buy?”. To answer this question simply, one
                        would say that your life insurance cover should be as much as your life goals and needs are
                        concerned. Consider the following prerogatives to get an idea of how much life insurance you
                        will need to buy.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Firstly, assess the situation your family is in.</li>
                    <li>Are there too many members dependent on you? This will help you answer how much cover you should
                        go for.</li>
                    <li>Other than that, consider the health conditions of your members.</li>
                    <li>Track if you have any sorts of debts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>Analysing all these questions will bring down to a general idea of how much life insurance you
                        would require. In general, it is recommended that one should take an insurance cover 10 times
                        the annual income with the addition of funds depending on the number of children. This thumb
                        rule is a great way to replace your income in case of any unexpected event.</span></p>

                <h2><span>What Factors Affect Your Life Insurance Premiums and Costs?</span></h2>
                <p>There are several factors that affect your life insurance premiums and costs. These are as follows:
                </p>

                <h3><span>Age</span></h3>
                <p><span>A major factor affecting the life insurance premium and cost is the age of the person. It is a
                        logical understanding that the younger you are, the more likely you are able to cover up the
                        complete cover payment with a lower premium cost. A young working professional, thus, would be
                        incurring a lower monthly or annual premium as compared to an older counterpart.</span></p>

                <h3><span>Gender</span></h3>
                <p><span>As per official data and statistics, it has been established that women tend to live longer
                        compared to men. That definitely means that women are able to stretch out their premiums in the
                        long run than men.</span></p>

                <h3><span>Health</span></h3>
                <p><span>Another major factor affecting the life insurance premium cost is the health history of an
                        individual. This factor goes hand in hand with the age factor as the probability of a person
                        with multiple morbidities facing an untimely demise is higher than a healthy individual. Any
                        insurance company will seek out an extensive health report of the person before making any final
                        decisions.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span>Some of the factors that can be addressed under health would be family health background and
                        whether smoking or non-smoking.</span></p>

                <h3><span>Field of Work</span></h3>
                <p><span>This factor is essential for an insurance company to compute how much insurance premium to
                        charge. This is important because there are many fields with high chances of fatality. The risk
                        factor associated with one’s job is indeed a major factor for premium cost
                        consideration.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <h2><span>Life Insurance Buying Guide</span></h2>
                <p><span>Just like any other investment that will cost you recurring charges or payments, buying an
                        insurance policy will also incur monthly/regular premium payments. The insurance policy that you
                        will buy will assess and generate a payment routine based on your profile and history. This
                        payment may or may not become a major recurring expense depending on your income. But it is
                        highly recommended to thoroughly assess the policies you will be purchasing and the company you
                        will be purchasing them from.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span>When considering a life insurance policy, review the following factors.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ascertain your needs:</b><span> Make a review of your needs as the gross necessities will
                            depend on the number of family members involved, health conditions, etc. Once you are aware
                            of your goals the following steps will be relatively smoother.</span></li>
                    <li><b>Scout top organisations that provide life insurance policies:</b><span> It is important to
                            find an institution that is established and trusted. This will ensure the highest quality of
                            service. Decide if you would like to buy a policy from government institutions, such as LIC
                            or SBI.</span></li>
                    <li><b>Decide the policy type that's best for you</b><b>:</b><span> There are a few varieties of
                            policy types that insurance companies offer. Assess the types based on your needs to decide
                            what kind of insurance to go for and compare their prices to grab the best
                            deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
                    <li><b>Go for the one you can afford:</b><span> After comparing, read about the terms and policies
                            of that particular company and decide whether it suits you. Else move to the next best. Make
                            sure that you consider a policy that you can afford to pay for. It should not be a burden on
                            you.</span></li>
                    <li><b>Company history matters:</b><span> You are leaving your fortune with a company in trust that
                            they will repay that in the future. Companies always check your eligibility and
                            creditworthiness. But that should not be a one-way deed. You should make sure the insurance
                            company you are investing in maintains the highest of your standards.&nbsp;</span></li>
                </ul>
                <h2><span>Benefits of a Life Insurance Policy</span></h2>
                <p><span>With an insurance policy, you can actually leave out much of your finance-related stress to the
                        insurance company. A policy will give you an opportunity to leave your family members with
                        much-needed future financial security. With many types of life insurance policies, it is
                        possible to find something that can also become an investment. Here are some of the major
                        benefits of owning a life insurance policy.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Financial Cover in case of Death</span></h3>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>Insurance can help your family and loved ones with financial cover during an untimely death.
                        This can take the pressure off the family in various ways. Insurances help cover funerals, deal
                        with outstanding debts, etc.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Profitable Return on Investments</span></h3>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>When you purchase an insurance policy, you are setting aside a small part of your income over a
                        regular period of time. This accumulated fund is returned to you at the end of the term of the
                        policy. There are many insurance types that offer survival bonuses and returns on investment
                        along with the principal.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Tax Exemptions</span></h3>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>Insurance policies can help you claim your tax returns as most of the policy premiums are tax
                        exempted. The Income Tax Act has given tax benefits on several types of investments for salaried
                        employees.</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Collateral</span></h3>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>A life insurance policy can be considered as collateral for availing of a bank loan. The loan
                        can be issued against the policy amount. It is to be noted that the loan amount will depend on
                        the premium amount as only a certain percentage of it will be assured. This can be extremely
                        handy in troubled times.</span></p>

                <h2><span>Documents Requirements for Buying a Life Insurance Policy</span></h2>
                <p><span>Insurance policies are issued after the submission of complete valid documents and a
                        post-background-check process. Identification and residential proofs are two of the mandated
                        documents asked for verification. The complete list of documents required for buying a life
                        insurance policy are as follows:</span></p>

                <p><span>When an insurance holder dies or the insurance policy reaches maturity, it is advised to reach
                        out to the insurance company as soon as possible. In case of death, the benefactor or any
                        relative can claim the insurance money. However, in the case of the expiration of the term, it
                        is the company that usually reaches out first. The company can send information regarding the
                        same a couple of months in advance.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span>To make an insurance money claim in case of a death, the IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and
                        Development Authority of India) has made the following suggestions:</span></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span>Inform the company as soon as possible.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Take assistance from the insurance company agent.</span></li>
                    <li><span>The benefactor needs to fill a claim form.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Provide the company with documents, such as a death certificate, policy letter, proof of
                            relation, deeds of assignments and a form with the information for discharge
                            execution.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>It is possible that the company might ask for medical certificates of the deceased for
