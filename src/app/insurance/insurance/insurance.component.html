        <p class="font14  text444 mb30 lineHeight22">An insurance policy can be defined as a contract between an
            insurance provider and a policyholder. Under this contract, the policyholder makes regular payments to the
            insurance company in return for a hedge against sudden financial or health risks. Depending on the terms and
            conditions laid down in the policy, the insurance company pays out a lump sum amount as reimbursement to the
            insured in the event of a claim.</p>
        <p class="font14  text444 mb30 lineHeight22">Various factors make up an insurance policy. A proper understanding
            of these can help you choose a policy better suited to your needs.</p>

                <h2 class="fontMedium mb15">How Does Insurance Work?</h2>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Usually, insurance policies are in effect for a specific
                    period of time. This is generally known as a policy term. You will be required to renew the current
                    policy or purchase another insurance policy at the end of the policy term. Usually, insurance
                    policies are in effect for a specific period of time. This is generally known as a policy term. You
                    will be required to renew the current policy or purchase another insurance policy at the end of the
                    policy term.</p>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">When you purchase an insurance policy, you are required to
                    make payments to the insurance provider as premiums. Some insurance policies require monthly
                    payments, such as health insurance. Others like home or vehicle insurance only require one or two
                    premium payments a year.</p>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Apart from premium payments, insurance policies also
                    comprise a deductible. This is the amount you will be required to pay during a claim before the
                    insurance company pays out its share.</p>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">For instance, if you have an Rs. 500 deductible included in
                    your home insurance policy, and you file a claim of Rs. 3,000, you will be required to make a
                    payment of Rs. 500. The insurance company will pay Rs. 2,500. You can also lower your insurance
                    premium payments by opting for a higher deductible.</p>

                <h2 class="fontMedium mb15">How Does It Reduce Financial Risk?</h2>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Imagine while driving you accidentally hit another car, and
                    your vehicle got damaged. If you have the right vehicle insurance, the insurance provider will cover
                    the car repair costs minus the deductible amount that has been agreed upon in the policy contract.
                </p>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Now, imagine there is a water leak in the bathroom, and it
                    ruins everything in that room and the adjoining bedroom. Usually, if you have home insurance, the
                    insurance company will pay to cover all or part of the damages, given that you have paid your
                    deductible.</p>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">It is important to know that insurance companies will only
                    cover costs for the losses that have been detailed in the insurance policy. This is why it is
                    advised to carefully read the offer document to know what all circumstances are covered.</p>

                <h2 class="fontMedium mb15">Benefits of Buying Insurance</h2>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Purchasing an insurance policy has numerous benefits for the
                    individual. It provides a cover against unforeseen financial losses and helps create a fund for life
                    after superannuation. Given below are some of the other benefits of an insurance policy:</p>

                <ul class="oList blueList listSpanbold mb20">
                    <li><strong><span class="fontBold">Cover Against Uncertainty:</span></strong>&nbsp;This is one of
                        the main advantages of having the right insurance policy. Insurance policies protect the insured
                        against any potential loss. Buying the right insurance policy is the best way to protect
                        yourself from the uncertainties of life.</li>
                    <li><strong><span class="fontBold">Cash Flow Management:</span></strong>&nbsp;Having to cover the
                        losses out of oneâ€˜s own pocket can significantly impact cash flow management. However, the right
                        insurance policy can help you tackle such problems. The insurance provider covers the cost of
                        any unexpected financial losses, thereby ensuring peace of mind.</li>
                    <li><strong><span class="fontBold">Investment Opportunities:</span></strong>&nbsp;Unit Linked
                        Insurance Plans invest a portion of the premium payments into various market linked investment
                        funds. This way, you can build an investment portfolio while also getting a proper investment
                        cover.</li>
                    <li><strong><span class="fontBold">Tax Benefits:</span></strong>&nbsp;Purchasing an insurance plan
                        has various tax benefits. The premium payments you make for the insurance policy are exempt from
                        income tax. Section 80C, 80D, and 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act detail all the tax benefits of
                        an insurance policy.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="fontMedium mb15">What is Insurance Premium?</h2>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">An insurance premium is the money that a policyholder has to
                    pay to avail of its benefits. Such payments are paid for policies covering life insurance, health
                    insurance, home insurance and vehicle insurance. An insurance premium can be regarded as a premium
                    for the insurance company. Further, it can also be defined as a liability to the insurance provider,
                    as the provider has to provide cover against the premium payments made.</p>

                <h2 class="fontMedium mb15">What is Life Insurance?</h2>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">In a life insurance policy, the insurance provider is
                    responsible for paying an assured sum to the holder or any specified nominee in the event of the
                    insuredâ€˜s demise. Depending on the insurance terms and conditions, in the event of death of the
                    policyholder or maturity of the policy, the provider may pay out a lump sum amount either in one go
                    or in instalments. You can avail several different life insurance policies to meet your
                    requirements.</p>

                <h2 class="fontMedium mb15">Types of Life Insurance Plans</h2>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Given below are some of the different types of life
                    insurance policies:</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Term insurance is a complete life insurance policy. The
                    policyholder receives the benefits for a set period of time in return for premium payments. In the
                    case of any unfortunate event during this time period, the insurance company pays out a lump sum
                    amount. The main feature of this policy is its affordability. You can get an insurance policy with
                    reasonable coverage for affordable rates.</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">In a term insurance plan, the insured is required to make
                    premium payments for the insurance amount mentioned in their policy. The premium payments must be
                    paid throughout the policy, which usually ranges from 5 to 25 years. The main difference between a
                    term plan and TROP is that upon maturity, the insurance company pays back the entire premium amount
                    paid during the policy term.</p>

                    <li class="fontMedium mb10">

                </ul>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">A ULIP is a lucrative combination of insurance and
                    investment plan that enables the policyholder to diversify their investment portfolio with the
                    promise of multiplied growth and insurance cover. If you invest in the right ULIP policy, you will
                    benefit from a flexible approach to investment planning. Simultaneously, your investment and
                    personal needs are covered by a financial safety cover in the form of the ULIP insurance cover.</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Endowment plans offer the features of an insurance policy
                    and a savings account. It aids in saving better over a set period of time, enabling you to get a
                    lump sum amount upon maturity. The maturity date is decided according to the terms and conditions
                    stated in the insurance policy. Further, it is also extremely useful for securing your familyâ€˜s
                    financial safety after your retirement. This can be very useful in making crucial decisions in your
                    life, like funding your childrenâ€˜s education, marriage or homebuying.</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">In a standard life insurance policy, a lump sum amount is
                    paid out to the nominee in the case of the insuredâ€˜s death. This is referred to as the death benefit
                    component of a life insurance policy. Alternatively, in a Money Back Policy, the insured gets a part
                    of the insured amount at regular intervals instead of a lump sum amount upon maturity. A money back
                    policy is an endowment policy with increased liquidity.</p>

                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Whole life insurance is the general life insurance policy
                    that provides complete coverage throughout the insuredâ€˜s life. Apart from paying out a lump sum
                    amount upon death of the insured, these policies also have a savings provision in which cash value
                    accumulates. The amount of money in the savings component earns interest at a fixed rate. It is
                    important to know that a whole life insurance policy is not the same as permanent life insurance, as
                    the latter further diversifies in various categories.</p>

                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Group life insurance is a type of insurance in which an
                    entire group of people is covered under one insurance policy. Usually, the policyholder is an
                    employer or organisation, and the policy provides cover to their employees. This is usually a more
                    affordable option than what the employees would pay to get an insurance policy with similar
                    benefits.</p>

                    lucrative investment plan that can aid in securing your childrenâ€˜s future. This insurance pays a
                    lump sum amount upon maturity with respect to life cover. Further, with this policy, you can also
                    opt for flexible payout options to sync with the important milestones of your childâ€˜s education.
                    While no one wants to think about illness or harm, it is important to provide your children with
                    adequate cover from such risks.</p>

                    Plans. In this insurance policy, you are required to pay a part of your income into the dedicated
                    plan. The main function of such policies is that the holder continues to receive regular income
                    after retirement. Because of the ever-increasing inflation and rising prices, investing in this
                    insurance plan is a good idea. The right retirement plan will help you maintain your regular

                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Health insurance is a policy that requires the insurance
                    provider to cover some or all of the insuredâ€˜s healthcare expenses in return for premium payments.
                    Usually, health insurance covers medical, surgical, prescription medicine and sometimes dental
                    treatment expenses. This policy can either pay the insured or directly settle the amount with the
                    concerned healthcare provider.</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Home insurance or property insurance covers the holder
                    against any unforeseen financial losses to their residential property. This policy protects the
                    physical structure as well as its contents. Some home insurance policies also provide cover against
                    'Acts of God'. These are any naturally occurring instances that could not have been avoided, such as
                    natural disasters.</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Travel Insurance is one of the most important prerequisites
                    before you start planning a trip or vacation. Travel insurance policies provide financial cover
                    against several travel-related risks and any medical costs that may arise as a result of
                    complications during travel. Further, it also covers any personal liability and changes to the trip
                    itinerary.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li class="fontMedium mb10">
                        <h3>Rural Insurance</h3>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">This insurance policy has been created for the general rural
                    public to protect their businesses, such as cattle, poultry, farms, etc. Policyholders can file a
                    claim for losses arising out of the death of cattle, losses in farming and other such circumstances.
                    Farmers are the backbone of the economy, which is why it makes sense for them to get coverage
                    according to their needs.</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">At the grassroots level, commercial insurance policies are
                    designed to provide businesses with cover against any events that may be a threat to their success.
                    Depending on the terms and conditions of your cover plan, it may be directed towards covering the
                    reputation, financial situation and wellbeing of the organisation. Further, commercial insurance
                    also covers various business entities like physical assets and employees.</p>
