                <div class="mt35">
                    <p><span>VPF or the Voluntary Provident Fund is an investment and retirement planning scheme backed
                            by the Government of India which provides an opportunity for the employees to voluntarily
                            contribute a percentage of their salary towards their respective Employee Provident Fund
                            (EPF). The employee concerned can contribute up to 100% of their salary and the organisation
                            or company is responsible to contribute 12% of their basic salary to their EPF. The
                            contributions from the employees are monthly and can also avail the option to make
                            additional deposits to their respective Provident Funds.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The scheme provides a safe alternative to the employees who wish to invest more than the
                            compulsory percentage of their salary to expand their retirement funds. It is to be noted
                            that the lock-in period for the amount deposited is five years. If the employee wishes to
                            withdraw the accumulated amount before the maturity period, the contributions will not be
                            eligible for tax exemptions. The funds are transferred to the appointed nominee in case the
                            employee meets an untimely demise.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h2><span>Features of Voluntary Provident Fund - VPF</span></h2>
                    <p><span>It is important to be aware of the following features before opting to invest in the VPF
                            scheme:</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Organisation</span></h3>
                    <p><span>It is mandatory for the organisations to provide EPFs if their strength is more than
                            twenty. To avail VPF scheme it is of utmost importance that the establishment the individual
                            is working in is recognised by the Employee Provident Fund Organisation. However, companies
                            with less than 20 employees can also open EPF accounts for their employees. But in such
                            cases, the onus is on the organisation not the individual employee. The employee can only
                            apply for the VPF scheme if only the organisation decides to open EPF accounts for its
                            employees.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Process</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The application process to apply for VPF is fairly straightforward. To initiate the process
                            the employee is required to connect with the HR department of the organisation appealing to
                            them to expand the Provident Fund allotment from their total salary. The employee would also
                            be required to fill out and submit a VPF form to the concerned department where information
                            regarding the desired amount that shall be allotted to the EPF from the basic salary shall
                            be clearly mentioned.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Cap on VPF Contributions</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The VPF offers flexibility to its investors as they can contribute any desired amount from
                            the total salary to the scheme. The employee can allot any percentage to the scheme ranging
                            from 12% which is the minimum and up to 100%. In the VPF scheme, the salaried employee has
                            total jurisdiction over the monthly contribution they would want to make to their EPF
                            account. But it is advised the employee decide upon a consistent figure for at least one
                            financial year for the benefit of the employer.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Section 80C&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The VPF scheme is covered under section 80C of the Income Tax Act which makes the
                            contributions eligible for tax exemptions. However, the tax deductions are applicable only
                            to investments up to Rs 1,50,000.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>Benefits of VPF</span></h2>
                    <p><span>The employees who wish to pursue this scheme would be eligible to avail of multiple
                            benefits such as high-interest rates, hassle-free application processes and simple
                            transferability. The VPF reduces the headache of salaried individuals who wish to invest
                            their salary in a safe and secure scheme.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Tax Exemptions</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The VPF features under the EEE category which means the investment will receive tax
                            exemption on:</span></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Contributions</span></li>
                        <li><span>Principle</span></li>
                        <li><span>Interest&nbsp;</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span>If the partial or total amount is withdrawn after the maturity period the amount
                            accumulated would also be eligible for tax exemptions.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Application Procedure&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The application procedure to register the account is simple. The concerned employee does
                            not have to indulge in any complicated process. The employee can simply connect with the HR
                            department of their respective company and start the process by filling out and submitting
                            the application form. The process does not take any time as the EPF and VPF accounts are not
                            exclusive. The process is in place so that the employee can avail of the option to make VPF
                            contributions.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Security&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>This investment scheme provides a secure option to the investors to partake in a
                            government-backed scheme. It saves the employee from the headache to explore and choose from
                            the various investment options which are not as steady and are much more prone to volatility
                            due to unforeseen factors. Guarantee of the accumulated contributions and interest from a
                            sovereign state makes it a viable option for investors who wants to frame a low-risk,
                            high-returns portfolio.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Interest</span></h3>
                    <p><span>
                        </span><span>The VPF scheme offers a competitive interest rate for its investors. For the year
                            2021-22, the government determined the annual rate of interest at 8.1% on EPF. Among all the
                            fixed investment options, the VPF offers the highest interest rate which is also exempted
                            from taxes.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Portability&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The process of transferring the VPF account while switching jobs is not a tedious one. The
                            government of India launched the Universal Account Number (UAN) which ensures easy
                            portability and transparency of the provident fund for its depositors.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Retirement Planning&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The VPF provides flexibility to the investor to plan for their retirement. The
                            contributions made to the EPF are to the choosing of the account holder which provides
                            a&nbsp; lot of scope to the employee to frame their retirement plan. The scheme offers a
                            safe and sound cocoon for the long-term investors to deposit their lifelong
                            savings.&nbsp;</span></p>

                            it is set to change due to the rise in global inflation. To curtail it, the government would

                            that the opening balance is nil for the first month.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p><span>Suppose, you’re employed at the ABC company on a salary of Rs 30,000 per month. The
                            mandated contribution you’ll have to make towards your EPF account is 12% of your salary.
                            But you decide to make an additional contribution of 8% towards your VPF. A contribution of
                            3.67% of the basic salary i.e. Rs 15,000 would be borne by the employer.</span></p>

                            reap annual tax deductions up to 1.5 lakhs under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. It is to
                            be noted that if the government sets the interest rate over 9.5%, the interest earned would
                            be eligible for tax. In case the concerned investor succeeds in contributing to their
