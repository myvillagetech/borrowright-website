                </div>

                    <h2 class="font24 mb10 text2828 fontMedium lineHeight36 ">What is Investment?</h2>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Investment is an act of funding an asset to churn
                        revenue out of it. This process is also known as "appreciation of assets". After investing in an
                        asset, as time passes, its value is expected to soar with time which in turn provides a higher
                        return price than what was originally invested. In simple words, investment is the method of
                        spending money to acquire more of it over time. The general purpose of buying an asset as a
                        means of investment is not to exploit or consume that asset but to generate more liquidity.</p>

                    <h2 class="font24 mb10 text2828 fontMedium lineHeight36 ">How Does an Investment Work?</h2>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">An investment works when you put in your money on an
                        asset through various mediums and platforms available, set it aside, and let it mature over time
                        so as to get a higher return on your initial investment. There are many investment types that
                        are duration specific such as short-term investments, long-term investments, etc.</p>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">It is unlike savings, where the goal is merely short
                        term, and the money's exponential growth rate is slow and steady. Invested funds are entirely
                        dependent on the asset's market value. Therefore, it is highly prudent to understand the annual
                        reports and strategies of a company before investing in it.</p>

                    <h2 class="font24 mb10 text2828 fontMedium lineHeight36 ">Types of Investment</h2>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">There are several types of investment that you can
                        consider. You may choose to invest in just one of these, or you can also choose to diversify
                        your portfolio through asset allocation.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Stocks</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Stocks or equities are security that acts as a fraction
                        of a company's ownership. An investor may consider buying these stocks and, depending on the
                        market value of the company, may yield a profitable raise over their initial investment. The
                        stocks are bought and sold over stock exchanges and other private agencies. There are strict
                        government rules and regulations to be followed while making these purchases.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Bonds</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Bonds are similar to a loan, where investors provide
                        funds to any companies that need financing. Similar to mortgages, bonds also have
                        characteristics where a borrower's company pays the investor a small recurring payment. Once the
                        maturity period is up, the company will repay the investor his complete amount.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Mutual Funds</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Mutual funds are a giant pool of money provided by
                        various investors that go into various companies' shares, bonds, stocks, etc. There are
                        dedicated expert fund managers who move these funds across different organizations shares, bonds
                        or stocks based on their performance, market value, etc. Investors usually get returns based on
                        the contribution they make.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">ETFs</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Much like mutual funds, an ETF or an Exchange Traded
                        Fund is a compilation of money sent in by various investors managed by expert fund managers.
                        However, unlike mutual funds, an ETF can be bought on a stock exchange platform like stocks and
                        shares.</p>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Banks in India also provide investors with an
                        opportunity to invest their money in mutual funds and ETFs. Each bank may have its own SIPs or
                        Systematic Investment Plans that investors can choose from.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Options</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Options are an exotic kind of investment where an
                        individual can hold an agreement. In this agreement, they will have the right to buy or sell a
                        company's underlying stocks, bonds, shares, etc., at a fixed price. They are worth considering
                        but only after assessing all the risks involved.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Annuities</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Annuities are an opportunity to receive a steady stream
                        of income for a specific period of time. Generally, investors like to have a steady retirement
                        income every month. The contract is signed between an investor and an insurance company where
                        the latter agrees to pay the former a recurring payment. Although annuities offer tax benefits,
                        it may be mandatory to pay a small tax at the start of the settlement.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Cryptocurrencies</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">In recent times, cryptocurrencies have been one of the
                        most popular choices to invest in. They became an ushering sensation that attracted more people
                        to invest with the expectation of huge returns. Crypto is a high-risk, high-return deal that not
                        only gave rise to thousands of new cryptocurrencies but also to various investment platforms and
                        apps. Names such as Bitcoins, Avax, Lucky Block or L Block, Ethereum, etc., are some of the
                        popular cryptos these days.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Commodity Futures</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">It is an instrument that allows a certain buyer the
                        right to buy a commodity at a preset cost and date. This contract can be used to reserve the
                        right to buy the commodity on a future date with the current prices. Buyers who have enough
                        expertise on a commodity and its market value can mostly go for such investments as they will be
                        able to take a calculated call on the commodity, irrespective of its future price fluctuations.
                        The trading happens in an exchange with an approved broker.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Security Futures</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">A futures contract is essentially a contract between a
                        producer and a consumer who happens to have a keen observation regarding a certain commodity and
                        is able to speculate on its future price hike. A futures contract grants buyers to enter an
                        agreement with the producer that they will buy the commodity at a future date but with the
                        current price. Now, if the price of the commodity actually rises, that means the buyers incurred
                        some profits over it. This type of contract has made its mark in the investment industry.
                        Although a little complex, futures are also a great way to invest.</p>

                    <h2 class="font24 mb10 text2828 fontMedium lineHeight36 ">Alternative Investments</h2>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">There are quite a few unconventional investment forms
                        usually designed for individuals with high net worth. This is mostly because these investments
                        require higher minimum fund sourcing and fewer authority regulations.</p>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">They aren't generally offered on regular stock exchange
                        markets and are less advertised. An alternative investment is pretty complex to value, not
                        easily convertible to liquid money and is considered highly risky. Some of the most common types
                        of unconventional investments are as follows:</p>

                    <h2 class="font24 mb10 text2828 fontMedium lineHeight36 ">Why is Investment Important?</h2>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Commodity prices and the cost of living, in general,
                        have witnessed an upward trend over the years. Everyone can agree that the prices at which
                        commodities were sold 20 years ago are not the same anymore. Under such circumstances, idle
                        savings in the bank do not prove to be enough, making way for the need for investments to create
                        a financially stable present and future.</p>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">The main reason investment is massively important is
                        that one has to make sure they are financially secure. Moreover, the money saved by a person has
                        the potential to be much more by getting involved in the market cash flow.</p>

                        <li>Investing motivates a person to think about their future and instil a sense of cultivating a

                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="font24 mb10 text2828 fontMedium lineHeight36 ">How Do I Start Investing?</h2>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">To start investing, it is extremely important to get a
                        thorough understanding of the market and its related dynamics. You need to do a lot of research
                        on the assets you are or will be investing in to infer its positive market impact in the future
                        logically. Here are a few handy tips for doing so and cultivating smart investing.</p>

                    <ul class="oList blueList listSpanbold mb20">
                        <li><strong>Understand the Market:</strong> The first and foremost step will always be to
                            educate yourself. Invest in yourself and in your upgrading of skills. Engage yourself in
                            learning about the subject matter that you will be stepping in. When investing, it is
                            imperative that you have a basic idea of how a certain company functions in the market and
                            how future demand for its products will affect the company's share prices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Life Goal:</strong>&nbsp;Make a life goal or objective for your future. It may be
                            anything like wanting a relaxed retirement, wanting the best education for your kid, etc.
                            Whatever you feel is worth setting aside your money for, think about it and possibly make a
                            note.</li>
                        <li><strong>Decide on the Risk Factor:</strong>&nbsp;There are many kinds of investments where
                            risks are varied. The only unavailable combination is low risk and high return. Except for
                            that, you need to decide what kind of risk you are willing to take. It is advised to go for
                            a low-risk, low return plan, which is generally taken for a long-term investment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Allocate Your Assets:</strong>&nbsp;Another important tip is to allocate your
                            assets. This means you can divide your monetary assets and allocate them to different kinds
                            of investments. It is always believed that never keep all your eggs in one basket for a good
                            reason. Allocating assets will not only help you ensure a good return but also help you in
                            diversifying your portfolio.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="font24 mb10 text2828 fontMedium lineHeight36 ">Which Investment Option Should You Choose?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Investment should always be chosen after assessing how
                        much risk you are willing to take and what your goals in life are. Out of the many plans
                        available, the best investment plan will completely depend on your expectations for the future.
                        A few suggestions for the best investment plans are as follows.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Direct Equity</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">An easy investment option to consider is allocating your
                        funds to direct equity such as stocks and bonds. Although the return on investment here is not
                        guaranteed, it has a higher chance of a decent return in the long run.</p>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Investing in stocks means that you earn a part of
                        ownership in a company, and whatever profit the company makes will affect the value of your
                        investment. And it goes without saying that a thorough analysis of the company's performance
                        over the years should be done. Stocks in India, which are proposed via stock exchanges, are
                        purchased through a Demat Account.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Mutual Funds</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">An investment type typically considered by both
                        beginners and experts is also generally a safer bet to regard. The main reasons for its
                        popularity are that mutual funds are managed by expert investors that analyse and monitor market
                        conditions and invest accordingly.</p>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">The fund managers compile money from several investors
                        and engage the money with various assets. Additionally, in mutual funds, investors are free to
                        choose their investment amount, which can be as low as INR 500 a month. They are also easily
                        redeemable and highly liquid.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">National Pension Scheme</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Administered and managed by the PFRDA (Pension Fund
                        Regulatory and Development Authority), the National Pension Scheme is a pension system that aims
                        to provide a regular income to senior citizens post-retirement.</p>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">The scheme was initially introduced for government
                        servants. However, later it was opened to the public as well. The only requirement for investing
                        in the National Pension Scheme is to have Indian citizenship.</p>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Moreover, investors are also required to be in an age
                        group of 18 to 70 with a sound mind. The National Pension Scheme is a great option for a
                        long-term investment with tax benefits. The other similar scheme released by the government of
                        India is the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS).</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Public Provident Fund</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is as popular as it is
                        safe. It is a go-to long-term investment plan for individuals that prefer a low-risk, low-return
                        factor when investing. PPF is generally considered for a tenure of 15 years but can be renewed
                        in chunks of 5 years. Investors get the option of depositing a minimum as INR 500 a month. The
                        interest rate usually stays around 7%.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Bank Fixed Deposits</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Another popular go-to investment option devoid of any
                        market risks and also guarantees regular interest returns is bank fixed deposits. There are tax
                        benefits, and also special interest rates offered to senior citizens. The interest rates usually
                        vary among banks due to competition.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Initial Public Offerings</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Whenever a private company offers its stocks up for
                        grabs to the public, they have to initiate an Initial Public Offerings or IPO. Initial Public
                        Offerings are basically stocks and shares wherein, to generate some funds for their operations,
                        companies allow the public to invest for asset appreciation.</p>

                    <h3 class="font20 mb10 text2828 lineHeight22 ">Real Estate</h3>
                    <p class="font14 text444 mb30 lineHeight24">Real estate is a major market for investment where
                        individuals buy and sell/rent properties inviting chunks of income their way. This is a major
                        investment choice because a property bought can go through massive value fluctuations depending
                        on the development of the locality or towns. There are several hot spots around metropolitan
                        areas that are investor-friendly in real estate.</p>

                            locate a platform where you can buy and sell these assets. A very common mode of investment
                            for the majority of the working population is SIP ( Systematic Investment Plan), offered by

                            more of a long-term commitment, and there is a sense of certainty involved. While gambling
                            is short-lived and contains unrealistic return expectations. Furthermore, investments are
                            generally made with a thorough understanding of the market and economic movement.</p>

                            Investments are always made after a thorough analysis of an asset’s annual records and
                            stats, investigating management strategies and behaviour, checking the validity of the
                            pursuit, etc. The risk factor is always calculated beforehand. On the flip side, speculative

                            your money, it will give you a larger return.</p>
