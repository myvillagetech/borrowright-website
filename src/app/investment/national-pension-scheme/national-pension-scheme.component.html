                    <p><span>The National Pension Scheme is also known as the National Pension System. In the NPS
                            scheme, the subscribers make a minimum contribution of Rs.6,000 in a fiscal year. This
                            contribution can be paid in total or as a monthly instalment of a minimum of Rs.
                            500.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span>In simple words, the money you invest in a market-linked investment and the returns depend
                            on the performance of the market. At present, the interest rate of NPS is 8-10% on the
                            amount you invest.</span></p>
                    <p><span>It is open to all employees from the public, private and even the unorganised sector except
                            for people who work in the armed forces. The National Pension Scheme can be extended for ten
                            years once the person turns 60 years old.</span></p>

                            classes: equities, government bonds, corporate bonds and other alternative assets. Also, the
                            returns offered depend on the market performance of the stocks and bonds.</span></p>

                    <p><span>It is a basic pension scheme with withdrawal limitations. The subscriber can only withdraw
                            25% of the contribution before the age of 60. However, 75% of the contributed amount is used
                            for buying the annuity from a life insurer.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span>An annuity means a series of payments made at fixed, regular intervals of time. An annuity
                            is planned in such a manner that the income is given to the person at regular intervals
                            until the death or maturity of the plan.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span>After turning 60, almost 60% of the contribution can be withdrawn, and the rest of the 40%
                            is used for purchasing the annuity from approved life insurance.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>National Pension Scheme Account for NRI</span></h2>
                    <p><span>The National Pension Scheme is available for Non-Residential Indians. They can open their
                            NPS account and enjoy their benefits. This scheme is a retirement scheme launched by the
                            government of India to secure the life of a financially self-dependent person. But there are
                            some criteria that NRIs who want to open an NPS account have to follow.</span></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span>The age of the NRI must be between 18 years and 60 years.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The individual must complete all the KYC norms.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The most prominent rule is that the amount invested must come from either an NRO or
                                NRE account.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3><span>Features and Benefits of an NPS Account for NRI</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The National Pension Scheme is specifically designed to empower retired people financially.
                            They offer several features that make the scheme risk-free and secure. Here are the benefits
                            and features of the National Pension Scheme Account for NRI:</span></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span>The National Pension Scheme comes in two different forms: NPS Tier 1 and Tier
                                2.</span></li>
                        <li><span>NPS Tier 1 is known as a pension account where it is mandatory to invest until it gets
                                mature. Once it gets mature, you can enjoy all the benefits.</span></li>
                        <li><span>NPS Tier 2 is all about an investment account under which the amount invested can be
                                withdrawn anytime.</span></li>
                        <li><span>NPS Tier 1 offers all tax benefits, whereas NPS tier 2 does not offer any tax
                                benefits.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The minimum amount required to open an account in Tier 1 is only Rs. 500. On the other
                                hand, under NPS Tier 2, the minimum amount is Rs. 1,000.</span></li>
                        <li><span>In a year, the total minimum payment under Tier 1 can be only Rs. 1,000 (minimum
                                amount per payment is Rs. 500). However, in Tier 2, there is no requirement for a total
                                minimum payment in a single year. But the minimum amount per payment is Rs.250.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Under Tier 1, the partial withdrawal feature is available. After a lock-in period of 3
                                years, you can withdraw 25% of the invested amount at once. You can withdraw the amount
                                a maximum of 3 times during the complete tenure of the scheme.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The exit option under Tier 1 states that a minimum of 40% of the total amount invested
                                should go for the annual scheme. However, the remaining 60% sum can be withdrawn
                                easily.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The exit option under Tier 1 states a minimum of 40% of the total invested amount. The
                                remaining 60% can be withdrawn.</span></li>
                        <li><span>40% of the withdrawn amount is tax-free.</span></li>
                        <li><span>If you want, you can also withdraw the amount before the age of 60 years but ensure
                                that it is ten years after the commencement of the scheme.</span></li>
                        <li><span>From the total amount, 20% can be withdrawn in the form of a sum, while the leftover
                                80% will go to the scheme.</span></li>
