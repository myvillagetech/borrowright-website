                    Linked Saving Scheme</h1>
                <div class="CmsContent_genericBanner___VBOA"></div>
                <div class="mt35">
                    <p><span>ELSS or the Equity Linked Saving Scheme is an exclusive mutual fund scheme that mainly
                            invests in equities and stock market. This scheme is particularly popular among investors
                            owing to the tax benefits as covered under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.. The investors
                            prefer this scheme to other investment options owing to the optimum liquidity this scheme
                            provides owing to its short lock-in period.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The ELSS employs an aggressive investment approach to maximise profits for the investors
                            who wish to invest in schemes that yield higher returns. The investors can invest in the
                            scheme by either employing SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) or by opting for lump sum
                            investments.However, if the investor is funding the scheme through the SIP option, the
                            maturity date of each installment would differ.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The ELSS schemes are subject to market risks as the money invested is volatile to
                            fluctuations in the stock markets, since this is a market linked savings scheme.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>Features of Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS)</span></h2>
                    <p><span>Given below are some of the features of an Equity Linked Saving Scheme:</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Equity Oriented Investment</span></h3>
                    <p><span>A major chunk of the fund is allocated towards securities who orientate their positions on
                            equities. However, most ELSS schemes also have a </span><span>fair</span><span> bit of
                            exposure towards fixed income securities also.This enables the investor to get higher
                            returns as compared to other investment options.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>No Provision for an Early Exit&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The scheme offers ideal liquidity for investments i.e. three years. However, there are no
                            provisions set in case the investor wants to exit the fund prematurely. After the maturity
                            period the investor has the option to reinvest or depart from the scheme by trading their
                            securities.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Maturity Period&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The maturity period for the scheme is three years which makes it the shortest among other
                            long-term investing schemes. This is ideal for investors looking for significant returns in
                            a shorter period of time. However, since these are a market linked scheme, the possibility
                            of guaranteed returns is bleak in comparison to other investment options.</span><span>
                        </span></p>

                    <h3><span>Investment Cap&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>There is no maximum cap on the investments made to the ELSS scheme. It also offers headroom
                            to the investors who are inclined to invest a smaller amount with minimum requirement going
                            as low as Rs 500. The minimum investment amount tends to differ according to the fund house,
                            so the investor can plan their investments according to their financial situation.</span>
                    </p>

                    <h3><span>Tax Deductions&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The Equity Linked Saving Scheme is one of the most widely used tax-saving investment
                            options.The ELSS offers annual tax return of upto Rs 150,000 in accordance with the Section
                            80C of the Income Tax Act. The profits from the investment made after the lock-in period are
                            exempted upto a limit of Rs 1,00,000.Any gains made over the exemption limit will be taxed
                            at a rate of 10%.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>High-Yielding&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The ELSS offers an avenue to the investors who want to invest in dynamic and aggressive
                            securities which tilt towards maximizing tax-free returns on the amount invested. The scheme
                            provides an opportunity for investors to expand their savings which would be attuned to the
                            high-inflation rates. As these investments mainly invest in equity options, a substantial
                            amount of returns can be generated throughout the investment period.</span><span>
                        </span></p>

                    <h3><span>Market Risks&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The fund predominantly invests in equity oriented securities which makes it prone to
                            volatility in the market. Since the returns on investment that you get from this scheme is
                            mainly linked to the stock market, it does not guarantee fixed returns. The returns that you
                            get from this scheme will depend on the ups and downs on the market.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h2><span>Benefits of ELSS</span></h2>
                    <p><span>Given below are some of the benefits of investing in an Equity Linked Savings Scheme
                            option:</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Rate of Returns&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The ELSS is a popular choice among the medium to long term investors as it is
                            directly</span><span> linked to the stock market. The other fixed income avenues such as PPF
                            and FDs lose out on the significant profits the market offers to the investors. The interest
                            accrued from these fixed income securities is fixed whereas the ELSS scheme strives for
                            maximum returns on the money invested. The potential to churn profits from the investments
                            is boundless if the investor chooses to invest in an efficient mutual fund.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Lock-In Period&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The lock-in period for this investment is just three years which makes it the shortest when
                            compared to other fixed deposit counterparts. Funds like PPF and FDs have decided on the
                            maturity period of 15and 5years respectively. Therefore, ELSS offers the highest returns
                            with the lowest investment lock-in period.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Tax-returns on Profits&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The scheme offers attractive tax advantages on the profits which are made by the investor
                            after the maturity period. The investor is eligible to take home their proceeds with little
                            tax levied as the scheme is covered under the Schedule 80C</span> <span>of the Income Tax
                            Act The taxpayer can claim exemptions upto Rs 1,50,000 in an investment year. Thus, an
                            Equity Linked Saving Scheme automatically entails lower tax expenses for the
                            investor.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Consistent and Convenient Investing&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>An investor can opt to invest in the scheme through SIPs where they can simply invest the
                            money on a monthly basis in a hassle-free manner. Through a Systematic Investment Plan, the
                            investor is in charge of the investment amount for each period. The investment amount can be
                            increased or decreased according to the market and financial conditions of the investor.
                            This also inculcates a sense of systematic saving as the investor will have to plan their
                            finances around their investment payments.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>Tax Benefits Under ELSS Scheme</span></h2>
                    <p><span>
                        </span><span>The investments made to the ELSS fund are eligible for tax benefits under the
                            Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. In accordance with the Act,, amounts upto Rs 1,50,000 are
                            eligible for tax deductions. The investor can save upto 46,800 annually due to these
                            exemptions.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>Why Should You Invest in ELSS?</span></h2>
                    <p><span>Given below are some of the benefits of investing in an Equity Linked Savings Scheme
                            product:</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Long-Term Gains</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The ELSS offers a lucrative deal to its investors as the mutual fund maintains a portfolio
                            that spreads across all the sectors to optimize profits for its investors. The fund gives an
                            opportunity to its investors to make long-term gains from the equity market. The diversified
                            portfolio ensures attractive returns to its investors who are seeking to make the most out
                            of their investments, while also ensuring relative investment safety.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Small-sum Investing&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>It provides a viable option for investors who are averse to risk-taking and are inclined to
                            invest small amounts on a consistent basis. Like any other mutual fund an individual can opt
                            for monthly SIPs which also offers an option of SIP top-up where the investor can increase
                            their investment in the scheme by increasing their monthly SIP amount.</span> <span>By going
                            for the SIP option, you can continue investing consistently and according to changing market
                            conditions.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Attractive Returns&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Since this scheme is directly linked to the stock market, there is always a possibility of
                            significant return on investment. The ELSS funds generate double the returns on their
                            investments. According to figures, on an average the ELSS generates close to 12% profits
                            over a ten year period as the funds are invested in equities that sponge higher returns from
                            the market. This is much higher as compared to other savings scheme options
                            available.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>Factors to Consider Before Investing in ELSS</span></h2>
                    <p><span>The investor who is inclined to invest in the ELSS scheme should account the following
                            factors before they commence with their investment:&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Purview of the Investment</span></h3>
                    <p><span>
                        </span><span>The investor should meticulously determine the horizon of their investment. The
                            interested individual should be willing to invest long-term to get the most out of their
                            profits to diminish market volatility as the money would be ultimately invested in the
                            equity market.&nbsp;</span><span>
                        </span></p>

                    <h3><span>Manage Expectations from Returns&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The money invested does not offered guaranteed returns unlike other fixed investments. It
                            is subject to market fluctuations so the investor shall be ready to hold their compose
                            incase the market is volatile. The investor should have a long-term association in mind with
                            the fund to yield maximum returns.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Risk Level</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Since ELSS funds mainly invest in equity options, the risks involved are somewhat similar
                            to that of investing in the stock market. However, this does not mean that ELSS are always
                            high risk fund schemes, there are different types of fund levels to cater to the needs of
                            different types of investors. It is important to note that while investing, high risks are
                            often linked to high returns. Be sure to choose your investment according to your financial
                            goals and plans</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Invest Through SIP</span></h3>
                    <p><span>A systematic investment plan is one of the ways to consistently invest small amounts into
                            mutual funds. This allows the investor to take advantage of the rupee-cost averaging and
                            bring down the average price the mutual fund units are purchased at. While SIPs are
                            considered the best way to start investing, they are particularly useful when the markets
                            are failing. In this method, you invest a fixed amount at regular intervals and by units at
                            the prevailing NAV. This eliminates the risk of a lump sum investment when the market is at
                            a high.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>How Does ELSS Work?</span></h2>
                    <p><span>The ELSS functions through the ELSS fund. The fund invests the majority of their corpus in
                            the </span><span>equity-oriented securities. The rest of the amount invested in various
                            money market securities. The capital appreciation ensures optimum returns to the investors.
                            The amount invested in ELSS is subject to the performance of the equities it has invested
                            in. The ELSS fund maintains a diversified portfolio ranging across all sectors in companies
                            with small, mid or large market capitalizations.</span></p>
                    <p><span>In simple words, if the market value of the stocks in which the ELSS funds has invested
                            increases, the investors also get a positive return. Alternatively, if the asset value
                            falls, the investors experience a loss on their investment.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>SIP vs Lump Sum</span></h2>
                    <p><span>The investor can invest in the ELSS scheme either through monthly or quarterly SIPs, or
                            with lump-sum payments. The investor should take into consideration the following factors
                            before selecting the mode of investment.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Investment Strategy&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The investment strategy is one of the major factors to be considered while deciding an
                            investment method. If the investor is inclined to invest consistently where they want to
                            allot a small percentage of savings then they naturally gravitate towards the SIPs. Whereas,
                            if the investor possesses a risk-appetite and wishes to yield major returns then they should
                            consider the lump sum payments option.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Usually, salaried employees prefer the SIPs as it provides them freedom to budget their
                            investments with respect to their incomes. The lump sum payments are preferred by
                            individuals who are seeking to invest a substantial amount to the fund. The investor can
                            also reap many tax benefits if they choose to invest at the beginning of the financial
                            year.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Sensitivity to the Market&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The investors’ money is prone to fluctuations in the market as the ELSS fund majorly
                            invests in equities. But it has been noted that the SIPs perform better when the market is
                            adverse as the consistent long-term investing model succeeds in diminishing the hostility of
                            market fluctuations. SIPs give the advantage to the investor to invest in funds across

                    <p><span>The lump sum payment strategy misses out on investing in funds across the business cycle.
                            But they are fruitful for investors who have an intricate investment horizon and
                            sensibilities and know how to capitalize on the ongoing bearish or bullish trend.
                            Substantial ROI can be generated from the lump sum investments if the investor employs a
                            sound investing strategy.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Lock-in Period&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>The lock in period for the in the ELSS scheme is three years. But the maturity date of the
                            amount invested is subject to the investment option an investor selects. In the case of lump
                            sum payments the investments are open to sale or reinvestment at one go. The maturity date
                            would be exactly after three year from the date they made their lump sum payment. Incase of
                            SIPs they mature with respect to the order in which the installations were made. After three
                            years, the amount invested is unlocked in the sequence in which the investments were
                            made.</span><span>

                    <h3><span>Nature of the Investor&nbsp;</span></h3>
                    <p><span>SIPs are popular among first-time investors since It provides an ideal platform for the
                            investors to incorporate significant investing habits and gain exposure to nuances of the
                            equity market from a long-term perspective. Due to minimum risk involved, the investor can
                            absorb and employ strategies which orient them towards better investment planning and
                            returns.</span></p>
                    <p><span>On the other hand, the lump sum payment is ideal for investors whose source of income is
                            seasonal. The lump sum payment option is predominantly availed by the self-employed
                            investors as they may find it inconvenient to keep up with the periodic
                            payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
