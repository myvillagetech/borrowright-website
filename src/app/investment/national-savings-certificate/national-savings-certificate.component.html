                    <p><span>Primarily, NSC was launched for individuals. Hence, HUFs (Hindu Undivided Families) and
                            Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) can't apply for this scheme. Also, only Indian citizens can
                            invest in NSC.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>Interest Rate on National Savings Certificate</span></h2>
                    <p><span>The National Savings Certificate interest rate stands at 6.8 percent per annum.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>Modes of Holding of National Savings Certificate</span></h2>
                    <p><span>Typically, there are three modes of holding NSC certificates. They are as follows:</span>
                    </p>

                    <h3><span>Single Holder Type Certificate</span></h3>
                    <p><span>As the name suggests, only one person can hold a single holder type certificate. Such a
                            certificate is issued only to an individual. However, the holder can also appoint nominees
                            for the NSC.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Joint 'A' Type Certificate</span></h3>
                    <p><span>As it's a joint certificate, it is issued to two adult holders. When the certificate
                            approaches maturity, the amount will be payable to both the holders. Either the NSC holders
                            or both the holders can operate Joint A Type Certificate.</span></p>

                    <h3><span>Joint 'B' Type Certificate</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Similar to the Joint A Type certificate, Joint B Type Certificate is also issued to two
                            adult holders. The only differentiation here is the payment of maturity value, which is
                            payable to only one of the two holders.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>NSC Eligibility Criteria</span></h2>

                            will be printed. You can collect it from the post office.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>Tax Benefits Provided by NSC</span></h2>
                    <p><span>If you are a subscriber and invest in NSC, an investment of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh in the NSC
                            can earn you a tax rebate under Section 80 of the Income Tax. Moreover, the interest you
                            earn on the certificate will also be added back to the initial investment and eligible for a
                            tax break.</span></p>
                    <p><span>For example, if you buy certificates worth Rs. 1,000, you will qualify for a tax rebate on
                            that initial investment amount in the first year. However, a tax deduction on the NSC
                            investment and the interest earned in the first year can also be claimed in the second year.

                    <h2><span>Transfer of National Savings Certificate</span></h2>
                    <p><span>The NSC certificate can be transferred from one person to another and from one post office
                            to another. The most significant characteristic of this transfer is that it won't even
                            impact the interest accrual or maturity of the original certificate. NSC allows the
                            following transfer options to an investor:</span></p>

                        <li><span>The applicant can transfer the certificate from one post office to another by
                                submitting the 'Application for Transfer of Savings Certificates' form at the same post
                                office which earlier issued the original certificate.</span></li>
                        <li><span>If you want to transfer a certificate from one holder to another, you must fill out
                                the 'Application for Transfer of Savings Certificate' form from Person to Person under
                                certain special conditions form at the NSC issuing post office. The 'Transfer of
                                National Savings Certificates' from one person to another is possible only once during
                                the scheme maturity.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2><span>Loan Against National Savings Certificates</span></h2>
                    <p><span>As NSC is backed by the government, it is one of the safest and most secure investment
                            choices you can make. While applying for the loan, you can use an NSC certificate as your
                            collateral.</span></p>
                    <p><span>NSC not only helps secure your future but also aids in meeting pressing needs. NSC
                            certificate holders can obtain loans against NSCs for various purposes, ranging from
                            personal to business. Most banks or financial institutions don't even need reasons to avail
                            of loans unless they meet speculative interests.</span></p>
                    <p><span>One can get loans against NSCs for household requirements, business improvement, education,
                            emergency medical expenses, etc.</span></p>
                    <p><span>So, if you seek a loan against NSC, you must consider the following:</span></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span>You must be an Indian resident</span></li>
                        <li><span>The interest rate rendered on NSC investment varies depending on the bank offering the
                                loan and the individual loan applicant.&nbsp;</span></li>
                        <li><span>The margin applicable to a loan against NSC relies on the time remaining until
                                maturity.</span></li>
